                               At GrabRozgar, we believe two people with equal talent should have equal access to job opportunities. But for equal access to become a reality, we must build products and programs responsibly to ensure they empower individuals regardless of their background or social status. This is true now more than ever as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified already challenging social inequity.

We start by asking a simple question: How can we ensure that our products and features work equally for everyone? Simply put, how can we level the playing field for all job seekers? This begins by understanding the impact of the products we build and how different audiences engage with them. Today, we're going a step further by sharing how we think about the unintended consequences and open-sourcing the model we use to measure the impact of our products.

                                While curiosity may have led to some important moments in our careers, most of us do not necessarily think of it as a must-have skill. It’s time to think again. 

Curiosity, used strategically, can not only improve the way we work, it can also transform the way we think by allowing us to see creative solutions that may be missed by others, make wiser decisions and increase our influence.

In fact, according to Becki Saltzman, GrabRozgar Learning Instructor and Founder of The Applied Curiosity Lab, curiosity can future-proof our careers. "We can search for and access everything...except what isn't there. Only curiosity inspires the questions that generate the answers we don't yet have access to. Without curiosity, new answers will cease to exist."

That’s why we were excited to find that curiosity is this week’s trending skill. As people continue to turn to online learning to adapt, many people across many industries are investing in this highly strategic skill. While all levels within the organization can benefit from it, we are seeing managers watch these courses at higher rates than all other levels within the organization which may mean they know something the rest of us are just now absorbing.
